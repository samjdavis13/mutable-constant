From the moment the movie began, right up until it finished, I was captivated by this intergalactic epic. For me, Interstellar is of the calibre that doesn’t come around very often — a movie that I will go out of my way to spend more money on, and see again in theatres. As of today, November 15, 2014, I have seen Interstellar twice. Once at an [Event Cinemas Vmax][1] theatre and I was fortunate enough to be able to see it at the [LG IMAX in Darling Harbour][2], Sydney (for likeminded nerds — yes, it was presented on 70mm IMAX film). Even more so in the IMAX, the sheer cinematography of this film is simply impressive. From the grainy/noisy corn fields of Earth to the crisp, frostbitten world seen on the poster, Interstellar is beautiful.

A good movie teach you something. Whether it is something external or internal, you should come out with more than what you went in with. For me, Interstellar taught me about crazy theories on spacetime that are apparently [scientifically sound][3]
