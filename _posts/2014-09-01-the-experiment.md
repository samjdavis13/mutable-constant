If you so happen to find yourself reading this, congratulations! You are more than likely the first person other than myself to be reading this.

Who am I?
I'm Sam.

Currently, I'm a design student at the University of Western Sydney, Australia. I have passion for functional design; design without the *cruft*. You can often find me creating websites, logos, icons and other such things. However, there is slightly more to me. Whilst I love design, I also love making things... Well, not real/physical things (ask my high school woodwork teacher), but software things. At least I try to. I really appreciate understanding the inner workings of *things*, I was always the kid pulling apart his new toys within hours of getting them. Software design naturally came as an evolution of that mindset. 

Recently I have been inspired by technology journalist [Andy Ihnatko][1]{:target="_blank"} to try something new. His YouTube series ['The Very Least I Could Do'][2]{:target="_blank"} made me seriously consider trying something that I am not traditionally very comfortable with. For me, that's writing. You see, I don't have trouble expressing myself visually, but I tend not to 'have a way with words' as some would say. During high school, English was consistently my worst subject. I excelled in subjects like Design and Music where I could express myself more practically. A key point that Andy has taught me is that something being unnatural or difficult is not a good enough reason to not even give it a fair go. So here I am. 

***This*** is an experiment. I am committing to writing one article/post each week for three months. I realise that that is not a large number, and for me that's a good thing. Something I've come to realise about myself is that achievable goals work better for me than astronomical ones. I love hitting a goal and then setting a new one, rather than missing a target and trying to do better next time. I'm not promising quality writing, or even interesting topics, but write I shall. I don't know what I am going to be writing about, that's the beauty of it. It will be what's on my mind at the time of writing. Inevitably, I will end up writing about technology, but I don't want to lock myself into that.

It would be really easy for me to geek out over setting up a blog and hand code a blogging platform before I even wrote a single sentence, but again, I want to step out of my comfort zone. As a result, at the time of writing, I have done zero setup for a website. I do not have a domain name in mind, software has not been chosen... NOTHING. I am simply writing this in an empty TextEdit document and more than likely, by the time I end up posting this online somewhere, I will have written more than just this one article. But that's not the point, the important thing is that I'm writing. The purpose of this experiment isn't to prove that I can successfully make a website (I know that I can do that) but to give something different a fair go, who knows, I might really enjoy it!

Thank you for sticking around until the end. You're awesome. *\*High five\**
