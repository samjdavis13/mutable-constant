[A lot][1]{:target="_blank"} has happened in the tech world since my last blog post. One of the most notable of these is the announcement and release of the 2014 model iPhones; iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This is that special time of year in which the whole world goes nuts. People suddenly think it’s reasonable to fork out $1000+ (or sign away their life to a carrier) to buy a little device that, in the end, is pretty much the same as what they already have. They camp outside in the streets for sometimes weeks on end in the hopes that they will be one of the first in the world to own one of these devices. And you know what? Minus the camping, I'm one of *those* people.

I not only pre ordered the iPhone 6 Plus last Friday (not really last Friday any more), but I also went and lined up at my local carrier to guarantee I got one on launch day. The saddest thing about this is that I'm not even a reviewer or a qualified journalist of any kind that requires me to have these devices as soon as possible. No, it's far simpler than that, I'm simply a geek.

In terms of my initial thoughts on this phone, all you really need to know is that it’s bigger. A *lot* bigger if you get the plus. I was lucky enough to be able to hold both sizes in my hands before making the final purchase, however I was already sold on the big one, holding it simply confirmed my suspicions. Honestly though, this years iPhone lineup is quite a simple one. The phones have better cameras, better battery life, bigger screens, and a really cool looking mobile payments solution (please come to Australia soon). If you’ve ever used an iPhone before you are going to be right at home, they are the same tried and true formula that has been working wonders for Apple since 2007.

The reason I wanted the plus was half so that I could replace my iPad and my iPhone with just my iPhone (possibly another post for more info) and half so that I could have the biggest phone. I have tasked myself with writing this entire post on my shiny new iPhone 6 Plus and so far it’s working out for me. The keyboard when in landscape mode is simply fantastic, I really love the addition of the arrow keys as well as dedicated cut/copy/paste buttons.

*It is at this part of my usual blog post that I decided to go crazy in-depth and do more of a ‘review’ of the iPhone; you’ve been warned, it gets geeky. If this scares or worries you in any way, shape or form — feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:samjd1993@gmail.com">here</a>. I should also note, that I didn’t write this whole post on my iPhone in the end, just the intro.*

### Design
I'm going to come straight out and say at, I *love* the way this device feels in the hand. Whilst it is a little bit slippery feeling due to the rounded edges, I think that every other fact about the design of this phone is superb! Currently, I’m still in the stage of new iPhone ownerage where I have a case on the phone (this will wear off in about a month or so), so I’ll let you know if my thoughts change after that. The rounded off glass in front of the screen really is testament to the way that Apple design hardware. It’s such a small thing to notice as you pull in from the left edge of the screen to navigate backwards, but it just feels so nice! 

I should also note the antenna lines that separate the otherwise solid aluminium (aluminum for the US) on the back of the phone. I don’t think they are really that big of an issue; just think of them as if it’s your [favourite pair of jeans][2] and the antenna lines are the oft over-emphasised, different coloured stitching. I see it as a design feature more than a drawback.

There are quite a number of people complaining about the camera lens protruding out of the back of the device, and whilst I think the overall device could be ever so slightly nicer if they had managed to stuff it all inside the case, I really don’t think it’s a deal breaker. People are saying that Apple could have just made the phone that little bit thicker, and then have more room for battery and everyone would be happy. I disagree with this. **Nobody** but the engineers at Apple truly understands the constraints that they are working with, and therefore,  **nobody** but the engineers at Apple can say, with any form of credibility how they should have designed the phone. I believe that we all need to step back and consider how far Apple has pushed the smartphone market forward and give them a little bit of credit in designing phone hardware; clearly, they are on to something and know what they’re doing.

What it comes down to is this: If you like the phone and the way it’s designed, that’s great, you should get one, you’ll probably be very happy with it. If not, I would strongly advise you don’t buy one. It’s that simple. 

### Camera
The camera… oh boy, that camera! I am SO happy with how this camera has turned out — there are numerous improvements that Apple has made to this years model including what they’re calling focus pixels which brings a DSLR quality focussing system to the phone and most notably for iPhone 6 Plus owners, Optical Image Stabilisation! This is a huge deal because it really makes the camera shine in mid-low light scenarios where there is just not enough light information to be captured by the sensor in a short shutter speed. This is going to be fantastic for any kind of indoor photography, gigs and numerous other situations in which studio quality light isn’t guaranteed. From my initial tests, I have not been let down by this feature! See the photo below for an example of an extreme low light shot — the subject was lit by a not very bright directional light in complete darkness outside.

This is super impressive. Barely any noise! I applaud you Apple for yet again leading the way in the smartphone camera market!

### Screen
The screen, especially on the iPhone 6 Plus is quite interesting. Rather than go to a truly 3x resolution, Apple has opted to render everything on screen as 2208x1242 and then scale everything to a clean 1920x1080. More than likely this is just an easier part to manufacture. 

In practice, the 6 Plus’ screen looks great! Text is as sharp as ever, images look vibrant and realistic thanks to the new lamination method which puts the pixels closer to the glass than they’ve ever been before. I really can’t fault the screen on this phone, it is by far the best screen I’ve ever used on a mobile device. 

### Size
The size… The meat of the reason to buy either the of the new iPhones. 

Having a big screen phone is great! I’ve been using android as my primary phone OS for the duration of the 4.7” Nexus 4 and the 5" Nexus 5 (for you folks playing at home, that’s 2 years) and honestly, one of the main reasons I used those phones was due to the larger screen. Having a large screen is so great for taking photos, watching videos, reading anything, and, in practice, *almost* anything. 

At the moment the app support for these larger screens is a bit abysmal. Most apps aren’t updated and you feel like you are using a fisher price version of the app for pre-schoolers. This is due to Apple’s automatic scaling so that we don’t get black boxes around our apps. The saving hope for this is that the apps that *are* updated look great, you get more content and in some super optimised apps, you get more interface like in Apple’s Mail app and a few key others. I’m really looking forward to seeing what developers do with the larger screen real estate. 

The device *is* harder to hold. The biggest area that I’ve noticed this is when trying to use my phone in bed. I have simply come to the conclusion that this is impossible. In day to day use, you have to hold the phone with two hands for almost everything. I think this is fine, as long as you know what you’re getting into. For me, the advantages in productivity and consumption far outweigh the disadvantages in hold-ability. This is something I would advise you go and have a hold of yourself before signing a contract or purchasing one of these devices. 

### Battery
Another area in which Apple has improved dramatically is the battery life. Again, this is especially true in the iPhone 6 Plus. Due to actual physical size of the devices Apple is able to cram more battery into it. I am an *heavy* iPhone user. Pretty well from my drive to work to my drive home I have podcasts playing. I do all my email on my phone, am constantly on Twitter, and on top of that its my phone (calls and texts... Remember those?). Basically, this all means that I would normally have to give my battery a bit of juice in the middle of the day if I want it to last until I go to sleep that night. This is *not* the case with the iPhone 6 Plus! There isn't much else to say other than this is awesome and is definitely a welcome feature. 

### Wrap Up
Overall, these phones are certainly worthy of the iPhone name. They improve on everything from last years iPhone 5s and even add some great new features. If you have your eye on either one of these phones I doubt that you’ll be disappointed if you get one of these for yourself. My word of advice would definitely be to go to a store and hold one before making any decisions regarding which size you choose — these phones are virtually identical barring size, battery and a slight improvement in the camera on the Plus. 

I won’t be giving these phones a numerical rating but they do win my approval and even go so far as to gain my recommendation. Thank you Apple for another satisfying product announcement. I look forward to seeing what the iPad’s have in store for us this year.
