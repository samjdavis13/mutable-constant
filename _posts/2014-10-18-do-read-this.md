I love that there are people in the world who dedicate a *massive* chunk of time each year to do such an in depth review of an operating system. I'm talking about, of course, [Mr. John Siracusa][1]'s incredible [review][2] of [Mac OS X Yosemite][3]. 

I haven't finished reading it yet, but am slowly making my way through it, and so far, I could not recommend it more highly! If you're a nerd like me, you will love this; stop reading this, and read that.
