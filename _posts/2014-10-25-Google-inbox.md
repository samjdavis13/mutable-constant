So a few days ago now, [Google][1] unveiled a new email client named [Inbox][2], which shares the same basic idea as [MailBox][3] by Dropbox — that is, one that is focussed on triage and treating your email like a to do list. For me, personally, this is exactly how I like to approach email. I feel as though this is the only way for me to approach it without becoming enfuriated. 

As I generally like a lot of the things that Google ships, I am pretty excited about this. That being said, Inbox is currently invite only. I have access to it, and would like to share it with some of my readers, so I thought I would run a super simple competition. 

To enter: Leave a comment

That's it. Super simple. The first person to comment will be guaranteed an invite. For every other submission I will wait until 5pm today Sydney time (Oct 25th, 2014), then I will close submissions and then randomly select 2 commenters to send invites to. 

Good luck!
