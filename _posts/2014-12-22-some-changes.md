So as <s>all</s> none of you are aware, I haven't been very active on this blog for a while now. I could come up with some ðŸ’© excuse as to how I've been far too busy to be writing a blog that no one reads. But as I have already indicated, it would be ðŸ’©.

First things first, I would like to formally finish my *experiment*... Although I did not follow through on it 100%, the outcome has taught me exactly what I wanted to learn from such an experiment. My conclusion is that I like having a blog. I enjoy being able to have a thought and be able to express it freely in a medium that I have absolute control over. So in that regard, this has been a complete success. On the other hand, I have discovered something that I was already fairly convinced of. That is that, I do not really enjoy writing. Although these two findings may seem contradictory, I am now in a position where I am confident in what I want this blog to be. 

I attempted a few different styles of writing in my experiment, as you may have noticed. I did some general thoughts writing, I did a fully fledged iPhone review (and secretly began but never finished an iPad review), I dabbled in technology reporting with my Google Inbox post, and I even started to put together a movie review (also, never finished) of [one of my favourite flicks][1] of the year. What I have discovered through these different styles of writing are a few things:

1. I cannot make my mind up about what I want to write about
2. I don't like writing long things
3. I tend to spend more time implementing things in my custom blog software than I do writing. (For instance, up until now, I hadn't implemented ordered lists)

With these things in mind, I am planning to do a complete wipe of mutableconstant.com and start from scratch with it all. I am going to release myself to write whatever I want to write, in whatever timing I'd like and most importantly ***how*** I want to write it. As a prediction, I assume that I'll mostly be writing about technology, though not complete reviews (I don't like writing them). I may dabble here and there in other matters, but that is less likely. Whatever the outcome, I believe that I will be happier in taking these actions. Finally, if anyone has *ever* read this blog, I sincerely thank you. 

I'll see you on the other side. 

Sam
