Yes. It has been almost a month since my last post.
Yes. I have broken my routine.
Yes. I’m a lying, worthless sack of meat. 
No. I’m not a lazy bastard.

You see, I *have* been writing. It’s just that what I’m writing is kind of long form for me. Also, I have just gotten through my mid semester review at uni, so I have been a bit crazy busy the past few weeks. But do not fear, I have not given up my writing endeavour. Something is coming.

Soon.
