Fine, if you're so insistant on reading this, have your own way then. The following is a link to a *little* browser based game, called Clicker Heroes, in which you click enemies in order to deal damage and eventually defeat them. That's basically it. You can't die. You don't win anything real. It's not even really difficult. 

What this game is, however, is highly addicting. <a href="" onclick="return false" class="spoiler" content="it also may or may not contain boss battles, and an even more addicting prestiging-esque system reminiscent of the Call of Duty franchise">tiny spoiler</a>.

Final chance, [don't click this unless you want the rest of your day/weekend to disappear][1]

Don't say I didn't warn you.
