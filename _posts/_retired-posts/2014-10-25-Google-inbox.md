So a few days ago now, [Google][1] unveiled a new email client named [Inbox][2], which shares the same basic idea as [MailBox][3] by Dropbox — that is, one that is focussed on triage and treating your email like a to do list. For me, personally, this is exactly how I like to approach email. I feel as though this is the only way for me to approach it without becoming infuriated.

As I generally like and use a lot of the things that Google ships, I am pretty excited about this. That being said, Inbox is currently invite only (another aspect that Google borrowed from MailBox), however, I have access to it, and would like to share it with some of my readers. So I thought I would run a super simple competition as a way of saying thank you to my audience.

Please note that at the time of writing I **do not** have any invites. As soon as I receive my batch of invites from Google, I will contact the winners of my little competition.

That's it. Super simple. The first person to comment will be guaranteed an invite. For every other submission I will wait until 10pm today Sydney time (Oct 25th, 2014 AEDST), then I will close submissions and then randomly select 2 commenters to send invites to. 

Good luck!
