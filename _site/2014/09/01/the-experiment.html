    <p>If you so happen to find yourself reading this, congratulations! You are more than likely the first person other than myself to be reading this.</p>

<p>Who am I?
I’m Sam.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m a design student at the University of Western Sydney, Australia. I have passion for functional design; design without the <em>cruft</em>. You can often find me creating websites, logos, icons and other such things. However, there is slightly more to me. Whilst I love design, I also love making things… Well, not real/physical things (ask my high school woodwork teacher), but software things. At least I try to. I really appreciate understanding the inner workings of <em>things</em>, I was always the kid pulling apart his new toys within hours of getting them. Software design naturally came as an evolution of that mindset. </p>

<p>Recently I have been inspired by technology journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/ihnatko" target="_blank">Andy Ihnatko</a> to try something new. His YouTube series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiu_NPjepa_7wnPq-3ahUI5sFg6OuaeoN" target="_blank">‘The Very Least I Could Do’</a> made me seriously consider trying something that I am not traditionally very comfortable with. For me, that’s writing. You see, I don’t have trouble expressing myself visually, but I tend not to ‘have a way with words’ as some would say. During high school, English was consistently my worst subject. I excelled in subjects like Design and Music where I could express myself more practically. A key point that Andy has taught me is that something being unnatural or difficult is not a good enough reason to not even give it a fair go. So here I am. </p>

<p><strong><em>This</em></strong> is an experiment. I am committing to writing one article/post each week for three months. I realise that that is not a large number, and for me that’s a good thing. Something I’ve come to realise about myself is that achievable goals work better for me than astronomical ones. I love hitting a goal and then setting a new one, rather than missing a target and trying to do better next time. I’m not promising quality writing, or even interesting topics, but write I shall. I don’t know what I am going to be writing about, that’s the beauty of it. It will be what’s on my mind at the time of writing. Inevitably, I will end up writing about technology, but I don’t want to lock myself into that.</p>

<p>It would be really easy for me to geek out over setting up a blog and hand code a blogging platform before I even wrote a single sentence, but again, I want to step out of my comfort zone. As a result, at the time of writing, I have done zero setup for a website. I do not have a domain name in mind, software has not been chosen… NOTHING. I am simply writing this in an empty TextEdit document and more than likely, by the time I end up posting this online somewhere, I will have written more than just this one article. But that’s not the point, the important thing is that I’m writing. The purpose of this experiment isn’t to prove that I can successfully make a website (I know that I can do that) but to give something different a fair go, who knows, I might really enjoy it!</p>

<p>Thank you for sticking around until the end. You’re awesome. <em>*High five*</em></p>
