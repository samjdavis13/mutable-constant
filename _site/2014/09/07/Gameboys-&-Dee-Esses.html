  <p>”…more than likely, by the time I end up posting this online somewhere, I will have written more than just this one article.”</p>

<p>Turns out I was wrong. But enough about that.</p>

<p>Today was one of the first times I have felt old. Don’t get me wrong, I am not old by any means. I’ve only just turned 21 and am still at University — I have plenty of life ahead of me. </p>

<p>I recently (within the last couple of months) purchased a Gameboy Color off eBay and fixed it up for myself. I had lost my original several years ago whilst on holidays in QLD, Australia. I didn’t really have any intention of playing it, but I thought it might be fun to mess around with every now and again… <a href="" onclick="return false" class="spoiler" content="and it was/is">spoiler alert</a>. So anyway, some of my family was around for lunch today and along with them my 7 year old cousin. I decided it might be slightly amusing to whip out my Gameboy and show him what I used to play on when I was a kid. </p>

<p>His first reaction was “what is it?” To which I replied “it’s what a Nintendo DS looked like when I was your age”. After he and his brother rather <em>roughly</em> worked out how to turn it on, he booted up my copy of Pokemon Blue. He was not impressed. Within 10 seconds of the game launching he was jabbing at the screen trying to get it to respond to his touches, I found this very amusing. </p>

<p>After a little while (and attempts at explaining why he could barely see the non backlit screen) I had finally taught him the basic concepts and controls of Pokemon and had him at a state where he was happy to just be playing the game and left alone in peace. I must admit, this gave a bit of a sense of achievement, like I had somehow bettered the world by showing a kid born this millennium what a Gameboy was, and more over, getting him to appreciate it!</p>

<p>When it was time for them all to go I asked him what he now thought of Gameboys, his response was something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was alright I guess. I mean, they’re not as good as stuff we have today. It’s kinda boring. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>*<em>Sigh…</em>* yep.</p>
