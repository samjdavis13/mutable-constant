Who am I?
I'm Sam.

Currently, I'm a design student at the University of Western Sydney, Australia. I have passion for functional design; design without the *cruft*. You can often find me creating websites, logos, icons and other such things. However, there is slightly more to me. Whilst I love design, I also love making things... Well, not real/physical things (ask my high school woodwork teacher), but software things. At least I try to. I really appreciate understanding the inner workings of *things*, I was always the kid pulling apart his new toys within hours of getting them. Software design naturally came as an evolution of that mindset.
